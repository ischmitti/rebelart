" Supposedly a CNN reporter found Osama bin Laden, took a television camera crew with him, went in to Osama bin laden's hideout, interviewed him and his top leadership, and he came out and told everybody 'within three weeks Osama bin laden is going to attack the United States and Israel.' Now don't you think that's kind of strange folks? You see because the largest intelligence apparatus in the world with the biggest budget in the history of the world has been looking for osama bin laden for years and years and years and can't find him. some doofus jerk off reporter with a camera crew waltzes right into his hideout and interviews him and i'm telling you be prepared for a major attack , but it won't be osama bin laden, it will be those behind the new world order. I wonder what "osama bin laden's" targets are supposed to be? And if this doesn't materialize within the next 2-3 weeks it will eventually materialize because they haven't succeeded in getting the guns out of the hand of the American people, nor have they succeeded in taking our freedoms away. And so I can tell you with a certainty they must do something terrible in order to stop this backlash and regain the sympathy of the mass herds of sheeple out there. "
