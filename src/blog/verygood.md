Bombs raining down in Yemen killing many civilians come from the western world, especially from the USA, UK and France. These violation of international humanitarian law is not highlighted. That´s because the Saudis are friends of the West and these are the `good guys´. In fact officials of these western world have repeatedly denied that the coalition have committed any violations of the laws of war.




"Saudi Arabia resumed its appalling war in Yemen last week and has already killed dozens more civilians, destroyed a school full of children and leveled a hospital full of sick and injured people. The campaign of indiscriminate killing – though let’s call it what it is: a war crime – has now been going on for almost a year and a half. And the United States bears a large part of the responsibility.


The Guardian view on Yemen: stop arms sales to Saudi Arabia


Editorial: Coalition air strikes resumed when peace talks stalled – and Britain is complicit in the civilian deaths that result

Put simply, the US is quite literally funding a humanitarian catastrophe that, by some measures, is larger than the crisis in Syria." (The Guardian)



After threatening to withdraw funding from critical UN programs, Saudi Arabia in June (2016) compelled the UN secretary-general to remove the coalition from his “List of Shame” for killing and maiming children and attacking schools and hospitals in Yemen. In 2015, Saudi Arabia used its position on the Human Rights Council, aided by its allies, to obstruct the creation of an independent international investigation into alleged violations by all sides. Neither Saudi Arabia nor a national Yemeni commission of inquiry has carried out credible investigations into coalition attacks that may have been laws-of-war violations. Allowing Saudi Arabia to obstruct independent scrutiny and avoid accountability threatens the credibility of both the Human Rights Council and the General Assembly, Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International said.

`Over the past three decades, the Saudis…have funded religious schools (madrasas) and centers that spread Wahhabism (a rigid, desert variant of Islam that is the template for most Islamic fundamentalists) around the world.´ (Fareed Zakaria)



Both ISIS and Al Nusra are protected by the Western military alliance.

The terrorists are the foot-soldiers of the Western military alliance. (Michel Chossudovsky, Global Research)



"ISIL´s (ISIS) ideology is rooted not in Islam but in Wahhabism. Charles Allen postulated in 2007 that Wahhabism represents a fascist devolution born from the mind of a pseudo-scholar: Muhammad ibn Abdul Wahhab, a tyrant whose sole purpose was to raise an empire of fear, right at the heart of Islam, to deceptively draw on its religious legitimacy.

Wahhabism is nothing more than a cult, a heresy rooted in bloodletting, slavery and violence - an abomination of the mind so revolting that it can only be compared in its madness to Nazism."  (Catherine Shakdam)



"In reality, the country most deeply implicated in the attacks was Saudi Arabia, home to 15 out of 19 of the hijackers, as well as Osama bin Laden. Saudi ties to the 9/11 attacks were confirmed by the 28-page segment from the report issued by the “Joint Inquiry into Intelligence Community Activities before and after the Terrorist Attacks of September 11, 2001,” released to the public last July. The 28 pages had been stowed away in a Capitol Hill basement vault since 2002, with only members of Congress allowed to read them, barred from taking notes or discussing their content with the outside world." (Evan Blake, World Socialist Web Site)

"In order to maintain official ties to Saudi Arabia...., Washington´s principal Middle East ally for over 50 years and the largest buyer of American weapons - these facts had to be suppressed." (Evan Blake, World Socialist Web Site)




".....we know that the U.S. government will do anything even if it means doing something only the criminally insane would consider and that is to arm and support terrorists for geopolitical objectives." (Timothy Alexander Guzman, Silent Crow News)

"Im Klartext: Die politisch und militärisch Verantwortlichen in Washington - und mit ihnen die Verbündeten in Europa, der Türkei und den Golfstaaten - haben schon 2012 gewusst (oder hätten wissen können), dass der Aufstand in Syrien ganz gewiss nicht von der -gemäßigten Opposition- getragen wird, sondern von radikalen Islamisten." (Michael Lüders)




Bahrain, Katar, Kuwait, Oman, Saudi-Arabien, die Vereinigten Arabischen Emirate: Deutsche Firmen exportieren 2012 deutlich mehr Rüstungsgüter in die Golfstaaten. Allein Saudi-Arabien kauft für 1,2 Milliarden Euro ein. Dabei ist die Menschenrechtslage gerade dort besonders in der Kritik.


(Christoph Hickmann 22. Februar 2013 SZ.de)



"Es ist kein Geheimnis, dass der German Marshall Fund beste Beziehungen zu Geheimdiensten unterhält: Als sich im Juni 2014 der frühere Chef des saudischen und der Ex-Chef des israelischen Militärgeheimdienstes trafen, da geschah das wie selbstverständlich beim German Marshall Fund." (Udo Ulfkotte)




-ISIS is a US-Israeli Creation: Indication #1: ISIS Foreknowledge via Leaked DIA Doc


The DIA (Defense Intelligence Agency) is 1 of 16 US military intelligence agencies. According to a leaked document obtained by Judicial Watch, the DIA wrote on August 12, 2012 that:


“there is the possibility of establishing a declared or undeclared Salafist Principality in eastern Syria (Hasaka and Der Zor), and this is exactly what the supporting powers to the opposition want, in order to isolate the Syrian regime …”


This was written before ISIS came on to the world stage. Clearly ISIS was no random uprising, but rather a carefully groomed and orchestrated controlled opposition group.

The ``supporting powers to the opposition´´ referred to are Saudi Arabia, Turkey and the GCC nations such as Qatar, who are in turn being supported by the US-UK-Israeli axis in their struggle to overthrow Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad.>> ( By Makia Freeman, Global Research, April 07, 2016)



"Nach  offiziellen Angaben sind allein bis Mitte 2016 mindestens 2000 verletzte Syrer in israelischen Krankenhäusern behandelt worden. Wie viele von ihnen Zivilisten sind und wie viele Dschihadisten, teilt die israelische Seite nicht mit. In ihrer großen Mehrheit dürfte es sich um Kämpfer handeln, ergänzt um einige Zivilisten zum Zwecke der Öffentlichkeitsarbeit. In westlichen, auch deutschen Medien ist über diese medizinische Hilfe wiederholt berichtet worden, wobei stets der humanitäre Aspekt im Vordergrund steht - Israel verhalte sich menschlich sogar gegenüber seinen Feinden. Das ist ohne jeden Zweifel löblich, aber die Hintergründe zu benennen, wäre gewiss kein Manko" (Michael Lüders)




"The BBC has uncovered details of a secret deal that let hundreds of IS fighters and their families escape from Raqqa, under the gaze of the US and British-led coalition and Kurdish-led forces who control the city.
A convoy included some of IS’s most notorious members and – despite reassurances – dozens of foreign fighters. Some of those have spread out across Syria, even making it as far as Turkey." (By Quentin Sommerville and Riam Dalati BBC News 13.11.17)
