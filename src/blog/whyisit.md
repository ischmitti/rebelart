Now G7, members are countries of established economic powers. This group has long secured and controlled raw resources found in the poor countries and maintained that at all expense. Now that they have got free reign over the weak they are treading them down further under the banners of free market. They dictate market and politics. The poor did not only get ripped off but left to bleed. If they condone and canÂ´t control greed capitalism in the first world, what should one expect what greed capitalism will do in poor nations; RAMPAGE!
