"The essential structure of world order envisaged by the US Government in the post-Second World War period was candidly described in a now declassified top-secret planning report produced by the US State Department´s policy planning staff, headed at the time by George Kennan…:


We have about 50 per cent of the world´s wealth, but only 6.3 per cent of its population…In this situation, we cannot fail to be the object of envy and resentment. Our real task in the coming period is to devise a pattern of relationships which will permit us to maintain this position of disparity without positive detriment to our national security. To do so we will have to dispense with all sentimentality and day-dreaming; and our attention will have to be concentrated everywhere on our immediate national objectives…We need not deceive ourselves that we can afford the luxury of altruism and world-benefaction…We should cease to talk about vague and…unreal objectives such as human rights, the raising of living standards, and democratization. The day is not far off when we will have to deal in straight power concepts. The less we are then hampered by idealistic slogans, the better"   (Nafeez Mosaddeq Ahmed)
