                        <p>The Artwork is expressed in words and reinforced with corresponding images to give a clear political message.</p>
                        <p>Hans Belting proposed that we should think beyond the western model in art: not only to expand
                        this model using experience elsewhere but to even approach art from the perspective of a multitude
                        of models. And according to Arthur C. Danto, we should use painting as a means for self-expression. </p>
                        <p>I have seen, through my extensive journey to many parts of the world at an early age, the divide
                        between the world of the have and have not. It became clear to me, after making a lot of questioning
                        and reading, the roots of these problems are political.</p>
                        <p>It comes to me naturally to express myself politically in art. The biggest task was to express the
                        political issue explicitly and in my own style. The individual painting is made up of words of a political
                        statement. The words are segmented and filled with colors to create the corresponding image. The
                        image and the words reinforce each other to give the message I want in the painting.</p>
